My submission to the Kaggle competition "[House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques]", ranked Top29% over 3000 teams.

All code is in main.py :

First I preprocessed the data, then two functions are used, function `test_models` include all the models I tried, function `blending` blend **4** models I tuned in `test_models`

Public score is **0.12266**
Any suggesions will be appreciated
